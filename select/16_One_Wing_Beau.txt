How do I forgive myself for my own mistakes?
If there's a way, I'll figure it out
But it might take more than a day
Could you possibly help me understand
I was wrong
But it's okay?
Would you even hold my hand speaking softly in my ear?
Would you even hold my hand speaking softly in my ear?
Could you possibly help me, please?
Oh, life is like a grain of salt in the eyes of God, a repetitious thought
But I know we are better
There's a reason we're together
We'll fly like two birds with one wing
To the gates of love
We'll flight and sing
Where can I find the word of advice
Written in a book?
Can I mend this wound with the pot of gold
Stolen from a rainbow?
Where in infinite stars in the sky can we find the one most bright?
Would you change your mind for me if I could show you the light?
Would you change your mind for me if I could show you the light?
Could you possibly help me, please?
Oh, life is like a grain of salt in the eyes of God, a repetitious thought
But I know we are better
There's a reason we're together
We'll fly like two birds with one wing
To the gates of love
We'll flight and sing
It's not so hard to admit I didn't mean that
Can we sacrifice the ego within us
Oooooooh
Give up our pride and start misreading
I'm sorry for misreading
We'll fly like two birds with one wing
To the gates of love
We'll flight and sing
We'll fly like two birds with one wing
To the gates of love
We'll flight and sing
