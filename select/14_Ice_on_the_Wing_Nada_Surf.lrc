[00:15.47] I am made of Sopwith Camel
[00:18.17] Sherman PT-17, sixty and cloudy, I go slow
[00:28.14] Compared to modernity I am a humming bee
[00:32.68] Sweater-weather and
[00:35.37] Hugs and drugs and movies
[00:47.87] 
[00:41.68] But baby ice
[00:43.43] Is growing on the wing
[00:48.03] Baby ice is growing on the wing
[00:53.48] You rolled the dice but
[00:56.16] You didn't know anything
[01:00.62] Underneath the oxide
[01:04.37] Underneath the oxide
[01:06.03] It's all the same song
[01:17.03] 
[01:13.36] I am made of no newspapers
[01:16.90] When the V-1 buzzing stopped
[01:18.77] Only prayers
[01:20.54] I am made of young curiosity, deluded piety
[01:23.36] Double-whiskey for the men
[01:26.96] Don't talk to thy neighbour
[01:29.61] If they don't take your same lord as saviour
[01:34.19] In a songless meeting house
[01:35.93] Proud to be the only ones
[01:37.82] Who get saved in the end
[01:39.67] From hugs and drugs and movies
[01:54.67] 
[01:45.92] But baby ice
[01:47.73] Is growing on the wing
[01:52.24] Baby ice is growing on the wing
[01:58.63] You rolled the dice but
[02:01.39] You didn't know anything
[02:13.39] 
[02:13.09] What if I start now?
[02:14.99] Just like someone's watching me
[02:17.66] Somebody's watching me
[02:19.47] What if I start now?
[02:22.03] Just like someone's watching me
[02:37.53] 
[02:24.84] But baby ice
[02:25.74] Is growing on the wing
[02:30.22] Baby ice is growing on the wing
[02:36.57] Baby ice is growing on the wing
[02:43.88] Baby ice is growing on the wing
[02:50.10] Underneath the oxide
[02:53.74] Underneath the oxide
[02:56.50] Underneath the oxide
[02:59.27] It's all the same
